Hi there! My name is Riyaz Faizullabhoy and I'm a third year EECS major at UC Berkeley!

This semester I'm helping out as a [TA for CS61C](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/su13/).  I'm also a proud member and officer of [HKN, the EECS Honor society](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/).

In my spare time I like to learn new skills (recently, web scraping with [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), Android programming, and playing with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) on this website!), and play tennis.

While I enjoy working with many aspects of the EECS world, my particular interests include big data, biocomputing, and artificial intelligence.
