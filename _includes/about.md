Hi there! My name is Riyaz Faizullabhoy and I'm a second year EECS major at UC Berkeley!

I'm a proud member of HKN, the EECS Honor society.

In my spare time I like to learn new skills (recently, web scraping with BeautifulSoup, Android programming, and playing with Jekyll on this website!), and play tennis.

While I enjoy working with many aspects of the EECS world, my particular interests include big data, biocomputing, and artificial intelligence.
